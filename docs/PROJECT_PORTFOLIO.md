# üìä NOVA Bus Pricing Pipeline - Project Portfolio

## üéØ Project Overview

**NOVA: Bus Seat Occupancy & Dynamic Pricing Analytics Platform** is a comprehensive data engineering solution that demonstrates enterprise-grade capabilities in data processing, real-time analytics, and intelligent pricing algorithms. This project showcases the complete software development lifecycle from problem identification to production deployment.

**Duration**: 14 days (June 10-23, 2025)  
**Team Size**: Solo development  
**Role**: Full-Stack Data Engineer

## üíº Business Context & Problem Statement

### **Industry Challenge**

The Indian transportation industry, valued at ‚Çπ50,000+ crores, relies heavily on fixed pricing models that fail to optimize revenue during varying demand periods. Traditional bus operators lose potential revenue during peak times and struggle to fill seats during low-demand periods.

### **Solution Approach**

Developed an intelligent data pipeline that analyzes bus schedule and occupancy patterns to provide dynamic pricing recommendations, potentially increasing revenue by 15-25% while maintaining customer satisfaction through fair, demand-based pricing.

### **Target Market Applications**

- **Transportation**: Bus operators, taxi services, ride-sharing platforms
- **Hospitality**: Hotel revenue management, dynamic room pricing
- **E-commerce**: Product pricing optimization based on demand
- **Utilities**: Time-of-use pricing for electricity and utilities
