    # Time-based adjustment: Peak hours â†’ Premium pricing
    time_multiplier = get_time_adjustment(departure_hour, booking_advance)

    # Route-specific adjustment: Distance, seat type considerations
    route_multiplier = get_route_adjustment(distance, seat_type)

    # Apply business constraints (70%-250% of base fare)
    suggested_fare = apply_constraints(
        base_fare * occupancy_multiplier * time_multiplier * route_multiplier
    )
